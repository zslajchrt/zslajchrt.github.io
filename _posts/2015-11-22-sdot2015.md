####SDOT 2015

This week I presented Object Metamorphism and Morpheus at the
[SDOT 2015 conference](http://sw-development.org/). The [presentation](https://github.com/zslajchrt/morpheus/raw/master/src/main/doc/papers/sdot2015_pres.pdf)
attempted to illustrate how OM may be used to model facial expressions for six
basic emotions and their combinations. On the other hand, the [paper](https://github.com/zslajchrt/morpheus/raw/master/src/main/doc/papers/sdot2015.pdf) focused
on motivations for and theoretical tenets of Object Metamorphism.

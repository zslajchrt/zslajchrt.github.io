###Wrapping Up

In the light of the above-mentioned findings,... strong



####Type Preservation
Why?


####Multidimensionality

TODO: What is it?
An instance may assume any of the set of predefined forms. Each form corresponds
to a point in a multidimensional space, where each dimension is represented by
an abstract "trait" (material) and values in the dimension are "concrete" traits (paper, metal ...).

modeling multidimensional data, combinatorial explosion of class declarations,
multidimensional polymorphism -> a need to describe all combinations in one expression

####Metamorphism

TODO: What is it? It

####Multidimensional Metamorphism

TODO: What is it?

a loss-less extension of types, the information about the types constituting
an object's class should percolate through all abstraction layers,
from the persistence layer, through the business layer to the presentation layer,
loose coupling,

cloning object state

the client is tightly coupled with a concrete implementation of a general interface:
to find out the type of the underlying entity, to determine the implemented
interfaces (isXXX methods)

The functionality of AlternatingUserMail should be provided by the platform.
